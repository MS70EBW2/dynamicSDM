> checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
  Found the following files/directories:
    'lastMiKTeXException'

My comment on notes:

Note is not present on GitHub R-devel check, but appears on rhub R-devel check. 

I do not find lastMiKTeXException in this directory when checked on my computer, nor does this fault appear on GitHub checks. Could be an erroneous note.
