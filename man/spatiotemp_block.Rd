\usage{
spatiotemp_block(
  occ.data,
  vars.to.block.by,
  spatial.layer = NULL,
  spatial.split.degrees = NULL,
  temporal.block = NULL,
  n.blocks = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ.data}{a data frame, with columns for occurrence record co-ordinates and dates with column names as follows; record longitude as "x", latitude as "y", year as "year", month as "month", and day as "day", and associated explanatory variable data.}

\item{vars.to.block.by}{a character string or vector, the explanatory variable column names to group sampling units based upon.}

\item{spatial.layer}{optional; a RasterLayer object, a categorical spatial layer for sampling unit splitting.}

\item{spatial.split.degrees}{optional; a numeric value, the grid cell resolution in degrees to split spatial.layer by.}

\item{temporal.block}{optional; a character string or vector, the time step for sampling unit splitting. Any combination of '"day"', '"month"' or '"year"' or "quarter".}

\item{n.blocks}{a numeric value, the number of blocks to group occurrence records into. Default; 10.}
}
\value{
Returns occurrence data frame with column "BLOCK.CATS", assigning each record to a spatiotemporal block.
}
\description{
Splits occurrence records into spatial and temporal sampling units and groups sampling units into multiple blocks that have similar mean and range of environmental explanatory variables.

\details{
Blocking is an established method to account for spatial autocorrelation in SDMs. Following Bagchi et al., (2013), the blocking method involves splitting occurrence data into sampling units based upon non-contiguous ecoregions, which are then grouped into spatially disaggregated blocks of approximately equal sample size, within which the mean and range of explanatory variable data are similar. When species distribution model fitting, blocks are left out in-turn in a jack-knife approach for model training and testing.

We adapt this approach to account for temporal autocorrelation by enabling users to split records into sampling units based upon spatial and temporal characteristic before blocking occurs.

Spatial splitting: If the spatial.layer raster has categories that take up large contiguous areas, spatial.split.degrees will split categories into smaller units using grid cells at given resolution.
Temporal splitting: If temporal.block is given, then occurrence records with unique values for given level are considered unique sampling unit. For instance, if temporal.block = “year”, then records from the same year are considered a sampling unit to be grouped into blocks. However, if spatial splitting is also used, then spatial characteristics may split these further into separate sampling units.
Once split into sampling units based upon temporal and spatial characteristics, these units are then assigned into given number of blocks (n.blocks), so that the mean and range of explanatory variables (vars.to.block.by) are similar across each (Moore et al., 2016).
