\title{Calculate sampling effort across spatial and temporal buffer from species occurrence records}
\usage{
spatiotemp_weights(
  occ.data,
  sampling.events.df,
  spatial.dist = NA,
  temporal.dist = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ.data}{a data frame, with columns for occurrence record co-ordinates and dates with column names as follows; record longitude as "x", latitude as "y", year as "year", month as "month", and day as "day".}

\item{sampling.events.df}{a data.frame, sampling events with column names as follows; record longitude as "x", latitude as "y", year as "year", month as "month", and day as "day".}

\item{spatial.dist}{a numeric value, the spatial distance in metres representing the radius from occurrence record co-ordinate to sum sampling events across.}

\item{temporal.dist}{a numeric value, the temporal distance in days, representing the period before and after the occurrence record date to sum sampling events across.}
}
\value{
Returns input occurrence record data frame with additional columns for sampling effort "SAMP_EFFORT" and relative sampling effort "REL_SAMP_EFFORT".
}
\description{
Calculates the total number of sampling events across a given spatial and temporal buffer from each occurrence recordâ€™s co-ordinate and date.
}
\details{
For each occurrence record, this function calculates the total number of sampling events within given radius (spatial.dist) from each record co-ordinate and days (temporal.dist) both prior and post record date.

In addition to total sampling events, the function also calculates relative sampling effort, scaling from 0 (least sampled) to 1 (most sampled).

Output could be used as model weights to correct spatial and temporal biases in occurrence record collections.
