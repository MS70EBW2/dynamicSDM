## Summary 

Across ecological research fields, species distribution and abundance modelling (SDM) is a major tool to understand drivers and patterns of species occurrence by relating occurrence records to environmental conditions. **dynamicSDM** facilitates the incorporation of environmental variables that are dynamic in both space and time to better represent our dynamic world in SDMs. 

Our functions are; **user-friendly**, with simple inputs and outputs; **highly flexible**, with open arguments for targeting study specifics; and **computer friendly**, utilising Google Drive and Google Earth Engine to minimise computing power and storage demands of high spatiotemporal resolution modelling. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of dynamicSDM like so:

``` r
# Install using github please
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:


<a href='https://RachelDobson.github.io/flexsdm'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RachelDobson/dynamicSDM/main/man/figures/Picture1.png" align="centre" height="550"/></a>


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
